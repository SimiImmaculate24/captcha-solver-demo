# Captcha Solver Demo

## Project Overview
The **Captcha Solver Demo** is an interactive, web-based application designed to simulate a real-world captcha-solving environment. The application is fully static and deployed on **GitHub Pages**, allowing users to interact with captchas directly from a web browser without requiring any backend server.

This project demonstrates skills in **frontend web development**, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as concepts such as dynamic DOM manipulation, canvas rendering, event handling, and user interaction timing.

## Features
- **Dynamic Captcha Generation:** Each captcha is randomly generated using 5 letters.
- **Interactive Canvas Rendering:** Captchas are drawn on an HTML5 canvas with randomized colors, slight rotation, and background noise to simulate real-world captchas.
- **User Input Verification:** Users can enter the captcha and click the **Submit** button to check correctness.
- **Timer Functionality:** A 15-second countdown timer automatically refreshes the captcha if no input is provided.
- **Refresh Button:** Users can manually generate a new captcha at any time.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays messages for correct and incorrect attempts.

## Instructions
1. **View Captcha:** Observe the 5-letter captcha displayed on the canvas.
2. **Enter Captcha:** Type the letters exactly as shown in the input box.
3. **Submit Captcha:** Click the **Submit** button to validate your input.
4. **Correct Input:** If correct, the application displays **"Captcha Solved!"** and generates a new captcha automatically.
5. **Incorrect Input:** If incorrect, the application displays **"Incorrect! Try again."**.
6. **Timer Expiry:** If 15 seconds pass without input, the captcha refreshes automatically.
7. **Manual Refresh:** Click the **Refresh Captcha** button to generate a new captcha at any time.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic captcha generation, canvas rendering, event handling, and timer functionality  
- **Git & GitHub Pages** – Version control and deployment

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the deployment of an interactive captcha-solving application entirely on a static platform (GitHub Pages). It provides a hands-on experience with frontend development, real-time user interaction, and application deployment, making it verifiable and professional for academic evaluation.
